## Full Transcription

Agents and cognitive architectures really is the big change and difference of when it comes to building software systems, how things are very different, right? So we'll be talking about agents and cognitive architectures in this module. We'll talk about agents as major components of more advanced generative AI applications. We'll talk about what is an agent and how agents can act as a central reasoning unit to solve more complicated tasks by really moving beyond just doing something like summarization, more like doing something like, I need you to figure out the order of operations to go and do this task, right? So really emulating human behavior is really what we're starting to see. We'll talk about multi-agent and multi-modal agents. So there's different types of strategies beyond just, you can use a single agent, you actually can use multiple agents. You can also use agents that can deal with images and audio and voice as well, which we're starting to see become more commonplace. We'll talk about components of an LLM agent. So to work with an agent, typically we're handing over the control to the LLM and we're giving it a task and then the LLM needs to go and reason on how to complete that task. But in order to do that, typically, we also need to give it tools and things that it has access to. So we'll talk about that. We'll explain the architecture of common agent-based LLM workflows for self-monitoring and autonomous generative AI applications, and then we'll identify LLM agent plugins and tools that can simplify this process.

**[00:04]** and difference of when it comes to building software systems,

**[00:07]** how things are very different, right?

**[00:09]** So we'll be talking about agents

**[00:10]** and cognitive architectures in this module.

**[00:13]** We'll talk about agents as major components

**[00:15]** of more advanced generative AI applications.

**[00:17]** We'll talk about what is an agent

**[00:35]** So really emulating human behavior

**[00:37]** is really what we're starting to see.

**[00:39]** We'll talk about multi-agent and multi-modal agents.

**[00:42]** So there's different types of strategies beyond just,

**[00:45]** you can use a single agent,

**[00:46]** you actually can use multiple agents.

**[00:48]** You can also use agents that can deal with images

**[00:51]** and audio and voice as well,

**[00:53]** which we're starting to see become more commonplace.

**[00:55]** We'll talk about components of an LLM agent.

**[00:58]** So to work with an agent,

**[00:59]** typically we're handing over the control to the LLM

**[01:02]** and we're giving it a task

**[01:03]** and then the LLM needs to go and reason
