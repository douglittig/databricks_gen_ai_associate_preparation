## Full Transcription

Now, in this module, building multi-stage reasoning chains will dive into the actual development process and some of the frameworks and tools to actually implement that design that we talked about. All right, so learning objectives. In this module, define main concepts for multi-stage reasoning systems. We'll talk about lane chain and its main components as one framework you can use to go and implement your generative AI applications. Now, I do want to put a note here that this is a very actively changing space that the framework that we define here, we're really wanting to talk about the ideas that lane chain brought to the picture, but there's also a lot of other frameworks out there and I expect more to come out as the industry continues to develop generative AI applications. We'll talk about Databricks products and features to help you when it comes to building these multi-stage reasoning systems. And then we'll describe the benefit of using compositional frameworks in AI development and then explain how multi-stage reasoning is more accurate representation of how humans actually handle problems as well, right? We're moving to this higher order of tasks and software development, right? Which is new for everybody.

**[00:11]** All right, so learning objectives.

**[00:13]** In this module, define main concepts

**[00:18]** We'll talk about lane chain and its main components

**[00:20]** as one framework you can use

**[00:22]** to go and implement your generative AI applications.

**[00:24]** Now, I do want to put a note here

**[00:25]** that this is a very actively changing space

**[00:29]** that the framework that we define here,

**[00:31]** we're really wanting to talk about the ideas

**[00:33]** that lane chain brought to the picture,

**[00:34]** but there's also a lot of other frameworks out there

**[00:37]** and I expect more to come out

**[00:38]** as the industry continues

**[00:40]** to develop generative AI applications.

**[00:43]** We'll talk about Databricks products and features

**[00:45]** to help you when it comes to building

**[00:46]** these multi-stage reasoning systems.

**[00:48]** And then we'll describe the benefit

**[00:50]** of using compositional frameworks in AI development

**[00:53]** and then explain how multi-stage reasoning

**[00:55]** is more accurate representation

**[00:57]** of how humans actually handle problems as well, right?

**[01:00]** We're moving to this higher order

**[01:02]** of tasks and software development, right?

**[01:05]** Which is new for everybody.
