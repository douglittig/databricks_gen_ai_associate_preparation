## Full Transcription

Hi everyone, I'm Patrick and welcome to Foundations of Compound AI Systems. So what's the goal in this module? Really the goal here is to understand what are compound AI systems and the shifts from models to compound AI systems. Today to achieve production and state-of-the-art applications and systems in the world of generative AI, it's compound AI systems that allow us to achieve those results. So in order to understand that, we'll talk about different types and components of compound AI systems. We'll talk about concepts of how do we go and decompose our complex application into these pieces such as intents, tasks, and pipelines. We'll discuss intent classification and chain building steps, describe the intent behind each prompt in a chain, and then distinguish between an LLM task and an LLM-based chain.
